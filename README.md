# Topic Modeling with Gensim

Explore the application of Topic Modeling using Gensim in this hands-on session. The notebook covers importing an API-based dataset, implementing Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithms, and measuring model accuracy with coherence scores.

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates practical applications of Gensim for Topic Modeling. Learn how to import datasets, apply LSA and LDA algorithms, and assess model accuracy using coherence scores.

## Contents

- `topic_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for hands-on Topic Modeling with Gensim.
- `dataset_api_import.py`: Python script for importing API-based datasets.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
